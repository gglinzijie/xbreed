## Introduction
Simulation has and will continue to play an important role in the study of genomic selection. ```xbreed``` is a simulation tool for purebred and crossbred genomic data as well as pedigree and phenotypes. It can be used for simulation of a population with flexible genome structures and trait genetic architectures. ```xbreed``` can also be used to evaluate breeding schemes and generate genetic data to test statistical tools. Furthermore, the package is handy, intuitive and has good performance properties in execution time and memory usage, even when handling large amounts of genetic data. This vignette intends to explain in detail how ```xbreed``` package works for the desired applications, and it includes illustrated explanations and easily reproducible examples. In conclusion, ```xbreed``` would be a useful tool for the methodological and theoretical studies in the population and quantitative genetics and breeding. 

## Workflow
Simulation in ```xbreed``` is basically carried out in two steps. In the first step, historical generations are simulated to create desirable level of LD and in the second step, recent population structures are generated, which can be as simple as a purebred line or a four-way crossbreed population. ```xbreed``` allows for a wide range of parameters to be incorporated in the simulation models in order to produce appropriate simulation data.  

```make_hp``` is the central function in the package (Figure 1). This function is used to create historical population and genomic structure of the trait of interest. A wide range of parameters can be specified for simulating the genome, such as: number of chromosomes, markers and QTL, location of markers and QTL, mutation rate and initial allelic frequencies. This flexibility permits for a wide variety of genetic architectures to be considered. As an example, user can simulate SNP chip genotypes data mimicking the real genotypic data of different livestock species.    

Other functions in the package are dependent to the function ```make_hp```. Function ```sample_hp``` is used to sample individuals from the last generation of historical population. This function can be used multiple times to sample individuals from the last generation of historical population to create recent populations.   

Function ```make_hp``` works on the output of the function ```sample_hp``` and also itself (Figure 1). This means that, once a recent population (e.g. RP1) is created by ```sample_hp```, function ```make_rp``` can be used, to create the second recent population (RP2) based on the data of RP1. Features of the functions ```sample_hp``` and ```make_rp``` are the same as both can create recent populations. However, the difference between these two functions is that, for function ```sample_hp```, male and female founders are always from the last generation of historical population, whereas, in function ```make_rp```, male and female founders can be selected from any generation of the population created by ```sample_hp``` or itself. In othe words, function ```make_hp``` can get the output of itself as input. See examples for more clarification.  

Function ```xbreed``` is used for crossing between populations. These populations can be the ones created by functions ```make_rp``` and ```sample_hp``` (Figure 1). Also, if user would like to have multi-way crossbreeding schemes such as three-way or four-way crossbreeding, then function ```xbreed``` can be used to get the output of itself as input data in order to create the multi-way crossbreed populations. Simulations of two-way and multi-way crossbreeding schemes are presented in the example section.

## Validation of simulated genomes
### Heterozygosity and Linkage disequilibrium
A number of arbitrary assumptions are made during the simulation of genomes, which makes it necessary to confirm that characteristics of the simulated data are similar to expectations. Equations for LD [$r^2$ (Hill and Robertson 1968)] and heterozygosity given some population parameters have been described in the literature. Deterministic predictions for these parameters may not exist for complex population histories, which may involve expansion or reductions in $N_e$. However, in such cases simulation programs can still be evaluated using a simple population history before moving on to more complex models. The expected heterozygosity of loci, $H_e$, for a given effective population size, $N_e$, and mutation rate, $u$, is $$E(H_e)\approx 4N_eu/[4N_eu+1]$$ (Kimura and Crow 1964). Under infinite-allele model, mutation creates new unique allele that never existed in the population. For finite-allele model, mutation does not create novel allele but rather modifies an allele to another allele within the allelic space with the same probability. Recurrent mutation can be reversible. At equilibrium $H_e$ is approximately, 
$$E(H_e)\approx 1-\left[ \frac{1+(4N_eu/k-1)}{1+(4N_euk/k-1)} \right]$$
where k is the number of possible alleles.

Similarly, expected values for LD have been described for scenarios without mutation, $E(r^2) \approx 1/[1+4N_ec]$ (Sved 1971), and with mutation, $E(r^2)\approx 1/[2+ 4N_ec]$  (Tenesa et al. 2007), where $c$ is the recombination rate. Hudson (1985) has shown that expectations are met only when loci with allele frequency, 0.05 are removed from LD calculations. 

###  Allele frequency distribution
Considering a finite population and the recurrent mutation of two alleles, Wright (1937) shows that the probability of the allele frequency ($p$) at mutation-drift equilibrium can be obtained by the asymptotic formula: 
$$prob(p) \sim p^{4N_eu-1}(1-p)^{4N_ev-1}$$

where $u$ and $v$ are the mutation rates of two alleles. This formula indicates the allele frequency distribution at mutation-drift equilibrium depends only on $N_e$, $u$ and $v$. Under the assumption that $u$  = $v$ , when $4N_eu$ is less than 1, close to 0, and greater than 1, the allele frequencies are expected to exhibit a U-shaped, uniform and convex distribution, respectively. 

## Evaluation of simulated genomes
In the following we assessed the characteristics of the genome simulated by ```xbreed```. An historical population was simulated for 2000 generations of random mattings with an effective population size ($N_e$) of 100 (50 males and 50 females). The simulated genome consisted of one chromosome with a length ($L$) of 1 Morgan, containing 2000 randomly spaced SNP loci. The initial minor allele frequency ($laf$) of all SNPs was assumed to be 0, meaning all individuals were completely homozygous for the same allele in the first generation of the historical population. Mutation occurred at a rate ($mutr$) of $2.5*10^{-4}$ per locus meiosis and involved the switching from one allele to another. Recombinations were sampled from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 1 per Morgan and were then randomly placed along the chromosome. The code used for assessing quality of simulated genome is in Example the mean heterozygosity and $r^2$ of all replicates was compared to expected values (Table 1).   
Table 1. Actual and expected Heterzygosity, $H_e$, and LD between adjacent loci, $r^2$, in simulated data.

```{r kable, echo = FALSE}
a<-data.frame()
a<-data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow=2, ncol=2))
colnames(a)<-c("Expected","Observed")
rownames(a)<-c("He","LD(r2)")
a[1,]<-c(0.09,0.11)	
a[2,]<-c(0.37,0.25)	
library(knitr)
kable(a)
```

Decay of average $r^2$ over distance in the last generation of historical population is in Figure 2. To determine the decay of LD with increasing distance between SNPs, the average $r^2$ was expressed as a function of distance between SNPs. SNP pairs were grouped by their pairwise distance into intervals of 1 cM, starting from 0 up to 100 cM. The average $r^2$ for SNP pairs in each interval was estimated as the mean of all $r^2$ within that interval.

![Decay of average r2 over distance](LD.png)


The allele frequency distributions in the last generation of the historical population are in Figure 3. Based on the simulation parameters defined above, the value for $4N_eu$ was 0.1 that is smaller than one. At mutation-drift equilibrium, for values of $4N_eu$ smaller than 1, a U-shaped distribution is expected. Also, we considered a case that $4N_eu$ was greater than 1. To do so, we increased mutation rate ($mutr$) to $5*10^{-3}$. When $4N_eu$ is larger than 1, normal distribution of allele frequencies is expected, respectively (Wright, 1937).

##Implementation and efficiency
The program is written in R, however time-consuming parts of each function in the package are in Fortran. So, compared to routine packages in R, ```xbreed``` is efficient in terms of computing time. The computing time and RAM demanding on a mediocre PC, with 2.3 GHz CPU, 4 GB RAM is 1.51 minutes and 5 Mb, respectively, for simulating 10K SNP panel, 1000 historical generations with $N_e$ = 100. The most important parameters affecting CPU time and memory are population size and the number of loci (markers and QTL). However, depending on the simulation scenario, other parameters such as 'gebv(c)' as selection criteria which demands training on each generation of simulation, and  saving huge outputs, etc. might become a computational bottleneck. Nonetheless, ```xbreed``` provides the user with enough options to manage the outputs or turn off unwanted computations. For example, one may optionally save genotypes only for last few generations avoiding large outputs.


## Examples
Examples below demonstrate some main features of the package. The mechanism to create markers, population structure, and trait phenotypes are detailedly proposed. The idea was to show some basic breeding schemes, however more complex simulation structures are possible according to the user desire.

### Example 5: Two-way crossbreeding  
Simulation of a two-way crossbreeding program. The crossbreeding scheme in this example involves three steps:    
Step 1: Historical population is created.      
Step 2: Two recent populations named as Breed A and B are created by sampling individuals from historical population.       
Step 3: Breed A and B are crossed.  
 
Schematic representation of the two-way crossbreeding in this example is in Figure 4.
